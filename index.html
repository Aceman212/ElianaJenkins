    <p>Hey so obviously this can’t possibly top any of the letters you have written for me because you are way too good at writing those. Still, I aim to do my best.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was going to write about how ass of a boyfriend I have been so far but you don’t deserve that, so I’m going to write instead about why I don’t deserve you.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You have the most beautiful soul I have ever had the grace of encountering. You do not just turn heads when you walk into a room, you make everyone feel something special, as if they have just met an angel. Everywhere I have been with you, I receive nonstop compliments on your behalf because your energy is that resplendent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You are incredibly thoughtful. All of the things I have bought you and done for you probably do not mean jack shit compared to whatever it is you are trying to surprise me with. I say this because I know you’ll make sure that the meaning behind it is emotionally fortified and that the feeling I will get from receiving it can never be recreated. On top of that, who the hell else would write me letters in the most classy stationery that exists?</p>
    <br>
    <p>You are a highly refined woman (yes, this is the compliment version of calling you posh, but you’re also fine as shit. There is not a single person on this earth for whom I would buy $14 almond butter or take out a loan to cook filet mignon steaks. There is also not a single person who has done all they have done to refine me with them, and you do that. If you’re doing well, you want me there with you, and that kind of support is hard to come by.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is a lot more I could say but this is supposed to fit into a letter, not my damn personal statement for grad school. I really could go into detail about how simply inadequate I am and have been as a human, friend, and lover, but I guess none of that really matters because you will love me anyway. That’s what this last bit is about: how much you love me. I still do not quite get it, why you love me, how you could love me, what you even love (I know you gave me a whole letter for that, but still). The fact remains that you love me, and not l my do i love you more, but I love that you love me. Ok so now I’m getting all choked up or whatever but, I do not know what I could have done without you in my life these past couple years. I do not know what I’m going to do without you in the spring. I do not want to know what I’m going to do without you right now.</p>
    <br>
    You do not like empty promises and neither do I, so I am not even going to promise anything right now. Just know that I love you, and will be more deserving of you because no matter what you say, I know I don’t deserve you.
    <br>
    <p>P.S. a lot of this was going to be for your birthday so sorry. Maybe I’ll write you another one. No promises.</p>
